<p>Hi, I'm Jack. Welcome to my personal website.</p>
<p>I like programming and writing. I'm an enjoyer of tea, fromsoftware games, and fantasy novels.</p>

<h3>about me</h3>
<p>
    I'm an independent software developer and author from the UK. I've spent the
    last few years working at hyper-growth startups creating content, wrangling
    data, and rendering <code>JSON</code>.
</p>
<p>
I'm interested in basically anything to do with computers, and I'm currently exploring backend, game development, systems, linux, etc. My goal is to learn and build in public on these topics on my website.
</p>
<p>
    I'm a curious and exceptionally fast learner, and I'm currently seeking
    positions where I can do meaningful work, and learn and improve at my craft
    改善 (<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen">kaizen</a>).
</p>
<p>
    If you want to work with me or just say hi, feel free to reach out at
    <code>finnala[at]finnala[dot]dev</code>.
