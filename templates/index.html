<p>Hi I'm Jack! Welcome to my personal website.</p>
<p>I make technical content on programming, linux, and other stuff.</p>

<h3>about me</h3>
<p>
    I'm an independent software developer and author from the UK. I've spent the
    last few years working at hyper-growth startups creating content, wrangling
    data, and rendering JSON.
</p>
<p>
    I’m currently exploring the web, data, linux and high-performance computing,
    and indie game development.
</p>
<p>
    I'm a curious and exceptionally fast learner, and I'm currently seeking
    positions where I can do meaningful work, and learn and improve at my craft
    改善 (<a href="https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen">kaizen</a>).
</p>
<p>
    If you want to work with me or just say hi, feel free to reach out at
    <code>finnala[at]finnala[dot]dev</code>.
